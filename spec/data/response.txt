This order is considered to be very slightly higher risk because the distance between the billing address and the user's actual location is larger than expected. The order is slightly riskier because the e-mail domain, yahoo.com, is a free e-mail provider. The order is slightly riskier because the phone number supplied by the user is not located within the zip code of the billing address for the credit card. The order is riskier because the shipping address given is a mail forwarding address, so there is no way to know where the products are actually going
